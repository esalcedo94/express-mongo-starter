### Technologies

- Used mongodb to to store data
- Materialize for CSS of the page
- Express
- Mongoose
- EJS

## Approach
- My approach was very simple. I made my MVC and had an outline for all my routes and my ejs files. Once I created my routes and tested them I would move on to doing the ejs for those routes. And then I focused on the Autorization part of the page allowing only users to EDIT, DELETE, and CREATE a game.
- I then focused the rest of the time to make the page look good with materilize.


## Difficulties
One of the road blocks, I had was when a user would sign up, it wouldn't log them in at the same time. I then figured out I had to do the same logic that I did when signing them in as a past user in the sign up route. 
Some things I still want to add:
- A message to the user when a password is wrong but a username does exist
- A message to the user when the username is not found and suggest them to sign up
